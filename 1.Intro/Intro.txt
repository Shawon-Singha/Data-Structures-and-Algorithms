Hi everyone . Welcome to you all in DSA.
I use C programming language .
I am learning DSA from Bangla Coding Tutor. Besides I am using chatGpt to clear some problems.
I divide Data Structures and Algorithms in 2 parts as our course plan...
 i. Data Structures

    1. Arrays
    2.Linked List
    3.Stacks
    4.Queues
    5.Trees
    6. Graph


 ii. Algorithms
    1.Searching
    2.Sorting 
    3.Recursion
    4.Dynamic programming
    5.Graph Algorithms
    6.Greedy Algorithms
    7. Divide and Conquer.


After this , i will learn DSA using c++....
